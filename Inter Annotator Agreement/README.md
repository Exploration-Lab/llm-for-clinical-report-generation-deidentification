## Inter Annotator Agreement
We computed the Cohen's kappa coefficient i.e. the measure of inter-annotator agreement for two sets of annotations. Initially, we tokenized each discharge summary using spaCy's tokenizer and labeled each token based on human annotations in BIO format. These token labels were then used to calculate the inter-annotator agreement between annotation by the human annotators. Secondly, to calculate the inter-annotator agreement between physicians, we used labels ('Real' or 'Synthetic'), assigned independently by each physician to 60 discharge summaries. The codes for calculating the Cohen's kappa coefficient are provided in this folder.
