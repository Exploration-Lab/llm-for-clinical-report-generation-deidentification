# DataGeneration
We have generated two datasets using in-context learning. We utilized Gemini-pro-1.0 and Llama-3-8B for generating discharge summaries. We generated 1,596 discharge summaries from Gemini-pro-1.0 using the n2c2 2006 dataset with in-context learning, producing around five discharge summaries per original summary. From Llama-3-8B, we generated 1,043 discharge summaries using the ICDS-R dataset, producing around 20 discharge summaries per original summary. The codes for generating the discharge summaries are provided this folder.

Sample discharge summaries generated from both Gemini-pro-1.0 and Llama-3-8B are also provided in the folder.
