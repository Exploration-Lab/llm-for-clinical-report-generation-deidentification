Gemini Prompt:
  Generate discharge summaries for Indian patients, capturing the essence of healthcare in India. The summaries should integrate conventional medical treatments with 
  traditional remedies, reflecting the holistic approach embraced by Indian healthcare systems. Incorporate prevalent Indian health conditions, treatments, and culturally 
  relevant follow-up care instructions. To ensure authenticity, each summary should include distinct patient details like name, age, address, contact information, hospital,
   doctor, and ID. Include prevalent diseases in India such as Tuberculosis (TB), Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases, Respiratory Infections, Hypertension, Dengue Fever, 
   Malaria, Hepatitis, Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), Cancer, Typhoid Fever, Cholera, HIV/AIDS, Japanese Encephalitis, Leptospirosis, Rabies, Tuberculosis of the Central 
   Nervous System (CNS TB), Rheumatic Heart Disease, Iron-Deficiency Anemia, and Chikungunya. Also, laboratory test reports of the chosen disease should be included. 
   Ensure the format of generated discharge summaries is similar to the summary given in the prompt, i.e., in XML format.  
        Example: Patient Summary: <discharge summary>  
        
        Generate the summaries that have a minimum of 2048 words. Ensure there is consistent consistency between the doctor's name, patient name, drug-disease, etc.

Llama-3-8B Prompt:
    Generate an extensive discharge summary of at least 2048 words tailored for Indian patients. To ensure authenticity, the generated summary must include distinct 
    patient-specific details like name, age, address, contact information, hospital name, doctor name, and unique ID. Maintain coherence across all the elements, 
    doctor's name, patientâ€™s identity, medications, diseases, etc. Ensure all the PHI (personal health information) elements are properly annotated to maintain privacy 
    and authenticity.
        
    The generated discharge summary should be XML-formatted with PHI annotations. The generated summaries should include following sections:\ Admission Details, Diagnosis
    / Chief Complaints, Allergies, Physical Examination, Medical History, Family Medical history, Treatment Plan, Investigations, Medications (List of medications prescribed
    at discharge), Follow-up Instructions, Procedures/Lab Tests Conducted (List of procedures or tests conducted during hospital stay, along with results if available), 
    and Special Instructions.
        
    Please ensure that these sections are incorporated into the generated summaries, but refrain from including them as tags in the output. The generated summary should be 
    properly enclosed within the <RECORD> and </RECORD> tags to ensure it's within the XML format.
        
    Here's an example patient summary: 
        
    Patient Summary: <discharge summary>
