PRESENT ILLNESS
Mr. Vamsi Krishna, a 52-year-old male patient, is admitted to our hospital with complaints of generalized weakness, fatigue, and bone pain. He has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperparathyroidism. He has been on treatment for these conditions, but his symptoms have worsened in the past few months. On examination, he was found to have dry skin, brittle nails, and tenderness on palpation of bones. His blood tests showed elevated levels of calcium, parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase. His vitamin D levels were low. A diagnosis of secondary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency was made.
HOSPITAL COURSE
During his hospital stay, the patient was given intravenous fluids and electrolytes to correct his dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. He was also given calcium supplements and vitamin D. His parathyroid hormone levels gradually decreased, and his symptoms improved. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his primary care physician and to continue taking his medications.

Take calcium supplements (1,000 mg elemental calcium daily) and vitamin D supplements (1,000 IU daily).
Continue taking your medications for hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus.
Lifestyle Modifications
Get regular exercise.
Eat a healthy diet that is rich in calcium and vitamin D.

Follow-Up Care
Follow up with your primary care physician in 4 weeks.
If your symptoms worsen or if you have any new symptoms, please seek medical attention immediately.
DIET

Good sources of vitamin D include fatty fish, eggs, and fortified foods. The patient should also avoid smoking and alcohol consumption.
ACTIVITY

OTHER

The patient was educated about his condition and the importance of following his treatment plan. He was also given information about the resources available to him, including support groups and online resources.
PROGNOSIS
The prognosis for patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism and vitamin D deficiency is generally good. With proper treatment, most patients can manage their condition and live a full and active life.
