Following the diagnosis, he was discharged to Bellaire City Hospital, where he continued to experience falls.  After one episode, he was forcibly picked up, and began to have L shoulder pain thereafter.  He also noted a cut over the L elbow on transfer to the NH that was slow to heal.   After several weeks of worsening shoulder pain, erythema, and warmth, he was re-hospitalized at Ouagadougou, where he underwent L shoulder aspiration.  MRI 10/87 demonstrated complete rupture of the rotator cuff, with associated large joint effusion.  Of note, he denied fevers, chills, or NS.\\n\\nL shoulder aspiration 10/10/87 demonstrated purulent fluid, with 2,800,000 WBC (97%PMN). Gram stain demonstrated GPC in clusters.  He subsequently underwent L shoulder I&D 10/12, with removal of 300cc of frankly purulent fluid.  He was started on cefazolin.  Culture results returned a pan-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolate (including to ampicillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, penicillin, rifampin).  Blood cultures were negative.  He was taken back to the OR 10/16 for arthroscopy, with extensive debridement.  Interop findings included demonstration of significant fibrinous tissue, with no normal-appearing cartiledge present.  A penrose was placed into a large cavity down the subdeltoid rescess, and a second in the subacromial space.  He was transitioned to ampicillin 2g q6 hours x 2 weeks, and then given amoxicillin (either 1g BID or 500mg TID, unsure which) x 2 weeks.  \\n\\n\\n\\nRepeat R shoulder MRI obtained 12/12/87, which was reviewed with staff radiologist, and demonstrated again complete tear of the supra/infraspinatus/teres minor/ subscapularis/ biceps tendons, with also persistent large joint effusion, extensive synovitis, and full thickness cartiledge loss of glenoid and humeral head.  Also noted was possible AVN of medial portion of the humeral head. Overall, was difficult to tell from MRI whether findings represented prior vs active disease.  \\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Moss was seen in the ID clinic 1/18, at which time he complained of a several week h/o progressively worsening L shoulder discomfort with activity.  He did not experience shoulder pain at rest, and had not recently noted erythema.  No drainage.  Appetite was near baseline, though he had experienced fatigue.  Blood glucoses had been well controlled.  His daughter in law brought in extensive data on his home vital signs, which revealed absence of fever except for a single isolated temp of 103, with stable pulse/BP, and overall well controlled blood sugars.    \\n\\n\\n\\nDate \\t\\tESR\\tCRP\\n\\n12/6/87\\t88 \\t23\\n\\n12/19/87\\t96\\t28\\n\\n1/18/88\\t67\\t9.4\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately,  Mr. Moss sustained a mechanical fall 1/19.  Following the fall, he had significantly increased hip pain.  Hip/pelvis films notable for femoral component with lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem. Orthopedic team felt that loosening of hardware would require another hip revision.  \\n\\n\\n\\nROS: as per HPI.  Denied having R hip pain prior to his fall.  No cough, sore throat, chest discomfort, abdominal pain, dysuria, diarrhea.  Extensive ROS otherwise negative.\\n\\n\\n\\nPmHx: \\n\\nh/o L shoulder septic joint s/p I/D in  10/87 c/b hemorrhage as per HPI CHF (EF 20-25%)\\n\\ns/p 5 hip surgeries, s/p bilateral hip replacements.

With regards to his shoulder, it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4-week abx course.  Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam, 2 months after completion of his course, it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis.  The MRI is difficult to interpret, and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes.  He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers (though confounded by multiple comorbidities).  Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection, our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically, off abx, for signs of recurrent infection.  However, given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement, would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder.  As such, would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics.  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated, and blood cultures were negative.  However, such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding, and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected.  This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening.  Alternatively, he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls, or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca (?read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis).  \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations:\\n\\n-hold antibiotics, including pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data\\n\\n-Aspirate shoulder.  Send fluid for cell counts, Gram stain, aerobic/anaerobic/fungal cultures\\n\\n-if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement\\n\\n-would obtain hip biopsies in the OR, again off abx, to assess for possible hip infection\\n\\n-likewise, would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement\\n\\n-check CK, given elevated Cr following fall, and possible rhabdo\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for this interesting consultation.

He then underwent May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/Taxus stent. He had symptomatic relief until 11/94 when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen. He then underwent repeat cath in 12/94 which revealed in stent restenosis of prior LAD stent and was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent. \\n\\nHe reports complete symptomatic relief after his stent in 12/94 and he was chest pain free until about a month ago when he noted left-sided chest pain and left jaw pain that was similar to his cardiac chest pain in the past.  The pain was both exertional and non-exertional.  He also noted gradually worsening exertional dyspnea as well, though he has mostly been sedentary.  He denies any orthopnea, PND, leg edema or palpitations.  He has been compliant with all medications, including ASA and Plavix.  He is currently chest pain free.\\n\\n\\n\\tPast medical history:\\n   DM \\nHTN \\nHyperlipidemia \\nCAD -CABG x 3 September 2092 WMMC (LIMA to D2, SVG to RCA, SVG to LAD) s/p PCI prox LAD Jan 2093, s/p Taxus stent to LAD 5/94, s/p Cypher stent to mid LAD 12/94 \\nCardiac cath 12/94: Diffuse 3 vessel CAD.

He reports that he has had an \\n18 pound weight loss since 1/78, visit with Dr. Frantz.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE:  Serum glucose in the office random is 376.  Weight is 173.75 pounds.  \\nDiabetes instructions as follows, pathophysiology of diabetes is reviewed.  Action and \\nrationale for oral agent versus insulin reviewed.  Hyper and hypoglycemic symptoms \\nreviewed.  Acute and chronic complications of diabetes reviewed.  Gross no concentrated \\nfruits diet reviewed.  Creatinine has been in the 1.3 to 1.5 range, over the last year.\\n\\nASSESSMENT:  Markedly elevated glucose now.\\n\\nPLAN:  Per consult of Dr. Frantz, M.D., we will start glyburide 5 mg tablet one p.o. q.d., \\nsince not able to use metformin in view of the patient's elevated creatinine.  The patient \\nwas given prescription for glucometer.  He will return to the office and will be instructed \\nin the use of the glucometer. Bring in glucose log at next visit. Alternate FBS with predinner glucoses.\\n\\n\\nWanda Lucero, M.D.\\n\\nWL:mata;967581.doc;DD:04/20/78;DT:03/21/78;DV:04/20/78\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

Following the diagnosis, he was discharged to Bellaire City Hospital, where he continued to experience falls.  After one episode, he was forcibly picked up, and began to have L shoulder pain thereafter.  He also noted a cut over the L elbow on transfer to the NH that was slow to heal.   After several weeks of worsening shoulder pain, erythema, and warmth, he was re-hospitalized at Ouagadougou, where he underwent L shoulder aspiration.  MRI 10/87 demonstrated complete rupture of the rotator cuff, with associated large joint effusion.  Of note, he denied fevers, chills, or NS.\\n\\nL shoulder aspiration 10/10/87 demonstrated purulent fluid, with 2,800,000 WBC (97%PMN). Gram stain demonstrated GPC in clusters.  He subsequently underwent L shoulder I&D 10/12, with removal of 300cc of frankly purulent fluid.  He was started on cefazolin.  Culture results returned a pan-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus isolate (including to ampicillin, cefazolin, clindamycin, penicillin, rifampin).  Blood cultures were negative.  He was taken back to the OR 10/16 for arthroscopy, with extensive debridement.  Interop findings included demonstration of significant fibrinous tissue, with no normal-appearing cartiledge present.  A penrose was placed into a large cavity down the subdeltoid rescess, and a second in the subacromial space.  He was transitioned to ampicillin 2g q6 hours x 2 weeks, and then given amoxicillin (either 1g BID or 500mg TID, unsure which) x 2 weeks.  \\n\\n\\n\\nRepeat R shoulder MRI obtained 12/12/87, which was reviewed with staff radiologist, and demonstrated again complete tear of the supra/infraspinatus/teres minor/ subscapularis/ biceps tendons, with also persistent large joint effusion, extensive synovitis, and full thickness cartiledge loss of glenoid and humeral head.  Also noted was possible AVN of medial portion of the humeral head. Overall, was difficult to tell from MRI whether findings represented prior vs active disease.  \\n\\n\\n\\nMr. Moss was seen in the ID clinic 1/18, at which time he complained of a several week h/o progressively worsening L shoulder discomfort with activity.  He did not experience shoulder pain at rest, and had not recently noted erythema.  No drainage.  Appetite was near baseline, though he had experienced fatigue.  Blood glucoses had been well controlled.  His daughter in law brought in extensive data on his home vital signs, which revealed absence of fever except for a single isolated temp of 103, with stable pulse/BP, and overall well controlled blood sugars.    \\n\\n\\n\\nDate \\t\\tESR\\tCRP\\n\\n12/6/87\\t88 \\t23\\n\\n12/19/87\\t96\\t28\\n\\n1/18/88\\t67\\t9.4\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately,  Mr. Moss sustained a mechanical fall 1/19.  Following the fall, he had significantly increased hip pain.  Hip/pelvis films notable for femoral component with lucency measuring more than 2mm superolaterally and along the stem. Orthopedic team felt that loosening of hardware would require another hip revision.  \\n\\n\\n\\nROS: as per HPI.  Denied having R hip pain prior to his fall.

With regards to his shoulder, it is difficult to know whether his infection was cured by the 4-week abx course.  Though his shoulder does not appear to be grossly infected on exam, 2 months after completion of his course, it is too early to determine sterilization of the shoulder on a clinical basis.  The MRI is difficult to interpret, and may well reflect prior inflammatory changes.  He did have persistently elevated inflammatory markers (though confounded by multiple comorbidities).  Given the possibility that he had cleared the infection, our plan as of the clinic visit Wednesday had been to observe him clinically, off abx, for signs of recurrent infection.  However, given his fall and the possibility of new hardware placement, would now favor a more aggressive workup of his shoulder.  As such, would recommend shoulder aspiration off antibiotics.  \\n\\n\\n\\nThe source for the L shoulder staph infection was never elucidated, and blood cultures were negative.  However, such septic arthritis often results from hematogenous seeding, and there is a small change that his R hip may also have become infected.  This could help to explain the prosthesis loosening.  Alternatively, he may have had hardware mechanical failure in setting of falls, or less likely involvement by his prostatic ca (?read of granulomatous disease around the prosthesis).  \\n\\n\\n\\nRecommendations:\\n\\n-hold antibiotics, including pre-operative prophylactic antibiotics to allow optimal culture data\\n\\n-Aspirate shoulder.  Send fluid for cell counts, Gram stain, aerobic/anaerobic/fungal cultures\\n\\n-if do not see contraindication to proceeding with planned hip replacement\\n\\n-would obtain hip biopsies in the OR, again off abx, to assess for possible hip infection\\n\\n-likewise, would send OR hip specimen to pathology to assess for infection vs. neoplastic involvement\\n\\n-check CK, given elevated Cr following fall, and possible rhabdo\\n\\n\\n\\nThank you for this interesting consultation.

The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar 2-10 years ago appearance of symptoms.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n\\nHypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure.\\n\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\\n\\nBilateral eye surgeries, right shoulder surgeries, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgery as mentioned above.\\n\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\\n\\nMultiple antibiotics including isoniazid, doxycycline, insulin, Cardura, Glucophage, Elavil, and Biaxin.  Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\\n\\nOn today s examination, the patient was noted to have a fairly long carpal tunnel scar on bilateral hands extending all the way to the volar wrist level.  Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted, the fourth trigger release, which was performed in 2062 as well.  The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space.  There is no locking or triggering, but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted.  Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well.  However, abductor pollicis brevis function is intact.  Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand, but otherwise normal examination.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\nAs above.\\n\\nPLAN:\\n\\nMy recommendation is that patient undergo very vigorous assessment for the median nerve function.  In addition to this, I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers.  It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVance-Ernest Yamasaki, M.D.\\nOrthopaedics \\n\\n\\nVEY/kiser\\t\\t59-56557099.doc\\n\\ncc:\\tHarold Elliott, M.D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

Patient has returned from her trip to Hong Kong.  Says\\n\\nthat it was a bit stifling, because she cannot drive and was dependent on other people\\n\\nfor transportation.\\n\\n\\n\\nStill has severe right shoulder pain.  Still also complaining of left jaw pain, that is\\n\\nworse when she has to open her mouth very widely.  Reviewed x-rays, which were\\n\\nnegative for fracture of frontal facial bones, and did not reveal obvious abnormality in\\n\\nthe TMJ area.  Has yet to receive an appointment from Dr. Vann for this\\n\\nshoulder pain.\\n\\n\\n\\nPatient was afraid to try the Vioxx, because she was told by the pharmacist that she\\n\\ncould not take it with ibuprofen. I explained to her that she should take the Vioxx in\\n\\nplace of the ibuprofen and she understands.  Is not willing to try Flexeril. \\n\\n\\n\\nPatient spent approximately 20 minutes describing her dissatisfaction and difficult\\n\\ninteractions with her children.  Has not asked for more Valium.  Has never been\\n\\ninterested in counseling prior to today.  Did not become tearful like she has in the\\n\\npast.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAsked for refill of sublingual nitroglycerin.  Prescription apparently was given to her\\n\\nlast spring.  Complains also of upper chest wall tenderness.  No clear to me what\\n\\ncauses her to take the sublingual nitroglycerine, but says when she takes it, it relieves\\n\\nher symptoms.  I have asked her if this pain is ever exertional, or is the same pain\\n\\nthat is reproducible when she touches her chest.  The patient seems to label her chest\\n\\nwall pain as the same as pain that she gets with exertion.  \\n\\n\\n\\nPROBLEMS: As per LMR.\\n\\n\\n\\nMEDICATIONS: As per LMR.\\n\\n\\n\\nALLERGIES: As per LMR.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: WD/WN female in NAD. Blood pressure 150/80.\\n\\nPulse 80 and regular.  Weight 152 pounds.  Lungs: Clear bilateral breath sounds. \\n\\nCOR: RRR. S1 and S2 without murmurs noted.  Extremities: No lower extremity\\n\\nedema.  Soreness over posterior right upper trapezius.  Full range of motion of\\n\\nshoulders. No tenderness over AC joints.  Chest wall tenderness over superior aspect\\n\\nof sternum and its border on left.  No masses or deformity noted.\\n\\n\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \\n\\n\\n\\n(1)  Chest pain: Certainly overdue for a follow-up with her cardiologist, Dr. Hunter\\n\\n     Mccarthy.  Referral done.  Also referred sublingual nitroglycerin.\\n\\n\\n\\n(2)  Elevated blood pressure.  Better than last visit, but remains slightly elevated. \\n\\n     At last visit, patient was reluctant to start a beta blocker.  Think she may need\\n\\n     this at future visit.  Will also refer back to her cardiologist.\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)  Elevated lipids, last checked last year. Several medications that patient appears\\n\\n     to be sensitive to side effects.  At next visit, will give lab slip to repeat fasting\\n\\n     profile. Positive checkup.  Would probably benefit from lipid lowering.\\n\\n\\n\\n(4)  Leg cramps.  Toward end of visit, patient also complained of more than 25\\n\\n     years of leg cramps.  Unable to take quinine because of allergic reaction. \\n\\n     Patient already takes Valium p.r.n. and I am reluctant to start any other\\n\\n     anxiolytics.  Will check electrolytes and calcium at next visit. \\n\\n\\n\\n(5)  History of sciatica.  Patient states in past that she has received steroid injection\\n\\n     for her lower back pain, which resolved.  Will simply follow with Vioxx, which\\n\\n     will hopefully help other pains that patient is experiencing.  Also continue with\\n\\n     her rheumatologist, Dr. Solomon, who has followed her chronic fibromyalgia and\\n\\n     chronic low back pain.\\n\\n\\n\\nReturn to clinic with me in six to eight weeks. \\n\\n\\n\\nADDENDUM: Patient's referral was receiving by Dr. Vann's office and they tell\\n\\nme she should be able to get an appointment for 6/95.  \\n\\n\\n\\nHelen Whitehead, M.D.\\n\\n\\n\\nHW/warren/stark\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

The patient did not, however, present to the Internal Medicine as \\nplanned.  She states that she has been \"too busy.\"  Her only complaint \\ntoday is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is \\nrelieved to some extent by acetaminophen.  \\n \\nEva continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day.  A noted in her \\nambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d. drug, however, \\nEva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than \\non an almost p.r.n. basis.  \\n \\nReview of systems is essentially normal.  Specifically, she denies any \\nheadaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath.  She also denies any \\nsymptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract.  She has no history of \\ndysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria.\\n \\nPhysical Examination:  She is robust appearing.  Vital signs are \\nsignificant for a blood pressure of 140/100.  HEENT exam is unremarkable.  \\nLungs are clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal \\nS1, S2.  No S3 is appreciated.  There are no murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen is \\nslightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds.  No masses are \\nappreciated.  Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not \\nsuggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion.  Indeed, exam of \\nher legs is entirely unremarkable.  \\n \\nLaboratory:  Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine \\nsediment and a urine creatinine.\\n \\nAssessment and Plan:\\n \\n1.   Hypertension:  Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure \\n     on her Procardia.  I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which \\n     she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, \\n     beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day.  I will see her in a few days in order \\n     to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug \\n     and also to check her blood pressure once again.\\n \\n2.   Right leg pain:  This would appear to be chronic and may well be \\n     related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the \\n     hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.)  I  have asked her to continue taking \\n     Tylenol and we will re-evaluate her need for more powerful agents, \\n     such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.\\nPROMPTCARE INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Rutledge, Eva\\nPage 2                                        29195561\\n                                              6-19-59\\n \\n \\n \\n3.   Elevated creatinine:  Unfortunately, Eva has not kept her Renal \\n     appointment.  In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I \\n     have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong.  \\n     She is to see him on the 29th of this month at 1:00 p.m. and I have \\n     also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him.  \\n     Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this \\n     elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney \\n     function.  \\n \\n4.   Health Maintenance:  The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear \\n     today, but again was \"too busy to stay that long.\"  She is to see me \\n     again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time.  Her \\n     February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and \\n     will not be repeated until next year.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n_________________________\\nUlysses Quijano, M.D.\\n \\nTD:PX:4740\\nDD:6-20-59\\nDT:6-19-59\\nDV:6-19-59\\n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n</td>\n",

Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out.  She was found to have a blood\\n\\npressure of 250 systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent\\n\\nheadaches.  She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being\\n\\nfound collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom.  She was transferred to the\\n\\nIntensive Care Unit at Neligh Clinic and treated for tonic-clonic\\n\\nconvulsions with diazepam and lorazepam. She also suffered a urinary tract\\n\\ninfection in hospital, treated with Cipro.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was transferred to the American Legion Hospital on October 02, 2089,\\n\\nat which time she was awake but unable to give a history. \\n\\n\\n\\nOn admission to American Legion Hospital she had a blood pressure of\\n\\n127/70, pulse was 80, and temperature was 99.3.  She had a myxedematous face and\\n\\nwas obese.  She was cardiovascularly stable.  Neurologically, she was able to move\\n\\nall four extremities with good strength and symmetrical reflexes.  Cranial nerves\\n\\nintact.  Initially, the impression was that patient suffered seizure secondary to\\n\\nelevated blood pressure.  Most likely, she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy. \\n\\nPatient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain, lumbar\\n\\npuncture, both of which were negative.  Electroencephalogram was  performed and\\n\\nshowed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally.  The patient's\\n\\nalertness and responsiveness increased gradually during the hospital stay.  She had\\n\\nan episode of chest pain which was associated with some ST flattening in the lateral\\n\\nleads.  Acute cardiac event was ruled out.  The patient underwent a course of\\n\\nphysical therapy and then, finally, was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.  A\\n\\nspecific cause of the patient's seizure was not found although it was assumed that\\n\\nthis might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with\\n\\nuse of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her\\n\\nthreshold for seizure activity.  Upon discharge, the patient was in stable condition.\\n\\n\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for seizure, type II diabetes mellitus,\\n\\npanhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary surg, hypertension, right arm bone\\n\\ntumor excision associated with right radial neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia.\\n\\n\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  See LMR.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Negative.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies alcohol intake, smoking.\\n\\n\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies visual or hearing disturbance, headaches,\\n\\nweakness, numbness, seizure activity, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, dyspnea,\\n\\nwheezing, cough, coryza, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain. \\n\\n\\n\\nPositive for mild nocturia with no dysuria.

The patient states that he has had past carpal tunnel release and trigger finger release of the bilateral hand and the symptoms that he is feeling now is somewhat similar 2-10 years ago appearance of symptoms.\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:\\n\\nHypertension, diabetes mellitus, and chronic renal failure.\\n\\nPAST SURGICAL HISTORY:\\n\\nBilateral eye surgeries, right shoulder surgeries, and bilateral carpal tunnel surgery as mentioned above.\\n\\nCURRENT MEDICATIONS:\\n\\nMultiple antibiotics including isoniazid, doxycycline, insulin, Cardura, Glucophage, Elavil, and Biaxin.  Please note that the patient is hepatitis C positive and hepatitis B positive.\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:\\n\\nOn today s examination, the patient was noted to have a fairly long carpal tunnel scar on bilateral hands extending all the way to the volar wrist level.  Long finger and right index finger scar at the base at the MP joint level is noted, the fourth trigger release, which was performed in 2062 as well.  The patient has rather stiff fingers overall with inability to fully flex the fingers all the way to the thumb space.  There is no locking or triggering, but fairly extensive stiffness involving the flexor tendon was noted.  Durkan s test was positive and Phalen s test was positive as well.  However, abductor pollicis brevis function is intact.  Other examination demonstrated some noticeable decrease in size of the muscle with some prominence of the vasculature on the radial side of the left hand, but otherwise normal examination.\\n\\nIMPRESSION:\\n\\nAs above.\\n\\nPLAN:\\n\\nMy recommendation is that patient undergo very vigorous assessment for the median nerve function.  In addition to this, I would like to actually consider providing him with the stretching exercises and flexion exercises as well as passive range of motion of the fingers.  It may be a little to early to consider this option until he returns with the result of EMG nerve conduction study.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVance-Ernest Yamasaki, M.D.\\nOrthopaedics \\n\\n\\nVEY/kiser\\t\\t59-56557099.doc\\n\\ncc:\\tHarold Elliott, M.D.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

Patient has returned from her trip to Hong Kong.  Says\\n\\nthat it was a bit stifling, because she cannot drive and was dependent on other people\\n\\nfor transportation.\\n\\n\\n\\nStill has severe right shoulder pain.  Still also complaining of left jaw pain, that is\\n\\nworse when she has to open her mouth very widely.  Reviewed x-rays, which were\\n\\nnegative for fracture of frontal facial bones, and did not reveal obvious abnormality in\\n\\nthe TMJ area.  Has yet to receive an appointment from Dr. Vann for this\\n\\nshoulder pain.\\n\\n\\n\\nPatient was afraid to try the Vioxx, because she was told by the pharmacist that she\\n\\ncould not take it with ibuprofen. I explained to her that she should take the Vioxx in\\n\\nplace of the ibuprofen and she understands.  Is not willing to try Flexeril. \\n\\n\\n\\nPatient spent approximately 20 minutes describing her dissatisfaction and difficult\\n\\ninteractions with her children.  Has not asked for more Valium.  Has never been\\n\\ninterested in counseling prior to today.  Did not become tearful like she has in the\\n\\npast.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAsked for refill of sublingual nitroglycerin.  Prescription apparently was given to her\\n\\nlast spring.  Complains also of upper chest wall tenderness.  No clear to me what\\n\\ncauses her to take the sublingual nitroglycerine, but says when she takes it, it relieves\\n\\nher symptoms.  I have asked her if this pain is ever exertional, or is the same pain\\n\\nthat is reproducible when she touches her chest.  The patient seems to label her chest\\n\\nwall pain as the same as pain that she gets with exertion.  \\n\\n\\n\\nPROBLEMS: As per LMR.\\n\\n\\n\\nMEDICATIONS: As per LMR.\\n\\n\\n\\nALLERGIES: As per LMR.\\n\\n\\n\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: WD/WN female in NAD. Blood pressure 150/80.\\n\\nPulse 80 and regular.  Weight 152 pounds.  Lungs: Clear bilateral breath sounds. \\n\\nCOR: RRR. S1 and S2 without murmurs noted.  Extremities: No lower extremity\\n\\nedema.  Soreness over posterior right upper trapezius.  Full range of motion of\\n\\nshoulders. No tenderness over AC joints.  Chest wall tenderness over superior aspect\\n\\nof sternum and its border on left.  No masses or deformity noted.\\n\\n\\n\\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  \\n\\n\\n\\n(1)  Chest pain: Certainly overdue for a follow-up with her cardiologist, Dr. Hunter\\n\\n     Mccarthy.  Referral done.  Also referred sublingual nitroglycerin.\\n\\n\\n\\n(2)  Elevated blood pressure.  Better than last visit, but remains slightly elevated. \\n\\n     At last visit, patient was reluctant to start a beta blocker.  Think she may need\\n\\n     this at future visit.  Will also refer back to her cardiologist.\\n\\n\\n\\n(3)  Elevated lipids, last checked last year. Several medications that patient appears\\n\\n     to be sensitive to side effects.  At next visit, will give lab slip to repeat fasting\\n\\n     profile. Positive checkup.  Would probably benefit from lipid lowering.\\n\\n\\n\\n(4)  Leg cramps.  Toward end of visit, patient also complained of more than 25\\n\\n     years of leg cramps.  Unable to take quinine because of allergic reaction. \\n\\n     Patient already takes Valium p.r.n. and I am reluctant to start any other\\n\\n     anxiolytics.  Will check electrolytes and calcium at next visit. \\n\\n\\n\\n(5)  History of sciatica.  Patient states in past that she has received steroid injection\\n\\n     for her lower back pain, which resolved.  Will simply follow with Vioxx, which\\n\\n     will hopefully help other pains that patient is experiencing.  Also continue with\\n\\n     her rheumatologist, Dr. Solomon, who has followed her chronic fibromyalgia and\\n\\n     chronic low back pain.\\n\\n\\n\\nReturn to clinic with me in six to eight weeks. \\n\\n\\n\\nADDENDUM: Patient's referral was receiving by Dr. Vann's office and they tell\\n\\nme she should be able to get an appointment for 6/95.  \\n\\n\\n\\nHelen Whitehead, M.D.\\n\\n\\n\\nHW/warren/stark\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

The patient did not, however, present to the Internal Medicine as \\nplanned.  She states that she has been \"too busy.\"  Her only complaint \\ntoday is of some right leg pain, which she says is chronic and which is \\nrelieved to some extent by acetaminophen.  \\n \\nEva continues to take Procardia XL 30 mg. PO q.day.  A noted in her \\nambulatory record, the Procardia is prescribed as a b.i.d. drug, however, \\nEva believes it gives her headaches and refuses to take it other than \\non an almost p.r.n. basis.  \\n \\nReview of systems is essentially normal.  Specifically, she denies any \\nheadaches, any chest pain, any shortness of breath.  She also denies any \\nsymptoms or signs referable to her urinary tract.  She has no history of \\ndysuria, of frequent urinary tract infection, or of hematuria.\\n \\nPhysical Examination:  She is robust appearing.  Vital signs are \\nsignificant for a blood pressure of 140/100.  HEENT exam is unremarkable.  \\nLungs are clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a regular rate and rhythm, a normal \\nS1, S2.  No S3 is appreciated.  There are no murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen is \\nslightly obese, nontender, and with normal bowel sounds.  No masses are \\nappreciated.  Lower extremities are without edema and joint exam does not \\nsuggest effusion or limitation of her range of motion.  Indeed, exam of \\nher legs is entirely unremarkable.  \\n \\nLaboratory:  Will include a repeat creatinine, a urinalysis and urine \\nsediment and a urine creatinine.\\n \\nAssessment and Plan:\\n \\n1.   Hypertension:  Eva has had persistently elevated blood pressure \\n     on her Procardia.  I have asked her to stop taking Procardia, which \\n     she blames for headaches and to begin taking taking atenolol, \\n     beginning at 50 mg. PO q.day.  I will see her in a few days in order \\n     to make sure that she is not having any difficulties with this drug \\n     and also to check her blood pressure once again.\\n \\n2.   Right leg pain:  This would appear to be chronic and may well be \\n     related to her work, which requires her to scuttle throughout the \\n     hospital at fairly high speed (She is a Pulping Control Operator.)  I  have asked her to continue taking \\n     Tylenol and we will re-evaluate her need for more powerful agents, \\n     such as nonsteroidals if the need arises.\\nPROMPTCARE INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Rutledge, Eva\\nPage 2                                        29195561\\n                                              6-19-59\\n \\n \\n \\n3.   Elevated creatinine:  Unfortunately, Eva has not kept her Renal \\n     appointment.  In order to prevent this from recurring a third time, I \\n     have called and made an appointment for her with Dr. Eileen Xayavong.  \\n     She is to see him on the 29th of this month at 1:00 p.m. and I have \\n     also left a message on his E mail mentioning Eva to him.  \\n     Hopefully, he can help ultrasound identify the etiology of this \\n     elevated creatinine before there is further loss of her kidney \\n     function.  \\n \\n4.   Health Maintenance:  The patient was scheduled to have a Pap smear \\n     today, but again was \"too busy to stay that long.\"  She is to see me \\n     again shortly, and a Pap smear will be done at that time.  Her \\n     February mammogram was essentially not suggestive of malignancy and \\n     will not be repeated until next year.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n_________________________\\nUlysses Quijano, M.D.\\n \\nTD:PX:4740\\nDD:6-20-59\\nDT:6-19-59\\nDV:6-19-59\\n ******** Approved but not reviewed by Attending Provider ********\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n   \n",

Initially the patient was seen at Neligh Clinic and cardiac ischemia was ruled out.  She was found to have a blood\\n\\npressure of 250 systolic at Neligh Clinic associated with persistent\\n\\nheadaches.  She was transferred to American Legion Hospital after being\\n\\nfound collapsed on the floor of the hospital bathroom.  She was transferred to the\\n\\nIntensive Care Unit at Neligh Clinic and treated for tonic-clonic\\n\\nconvulsions with diazepam and lorazepam. She also suffered a urinary tract\\n\\ninfection in hospital, treated with Cipro.\\n\\n\\n\\nShe was transferred to the American Legion Hospital on October 02, 2089,\\n\\nat which time she was awake but unable to give a history. \\n\\n\\n\\nOn admission to American Legion Hospital she had a blood pressure of\\n\\n127/70, pulse was 80, and temperature was 99.3.  She had a myxedematous face and\\n\\nwas obese.  She was cardiovascularly stable.  Neurologically, she was able to move\\n\\nall four extremities with good strength and symmetrical reflexes.  Cranial nerves\\n\\nintact.  Initially, the impression was that patient suffered seizure secondary to\\n\\nelevated blood pressure.  Most likely, she suffered hypertensive encephalopathy. \\n\\nPatient underwent neurologic evaluation including MRA of the brain, lumbar\\n\\npuncture, both of which were negative.  Electroencephalogram was  performed and\\n\\nshowed no epileptiform foci and diffuse temporal slowing bilaterally.  The patient's\\n\\nalertness and responsiveness increased gradually during the hospital stay.  She had\\n\\nan episode of chest pain which was associated with some ST flattening in the lateral\\n\\nleads.  Acute cardiac event was ruled out.  The patient underwent a course of\\n\\nphysical therapy and then, finally, was transferred to a rehabilitation facility.  A\\n\\nspecific cause of the patient's seizure was not found although it was assumed that\\n\\nthis might have been provoked by the hypertensive encephalopathy associated with\\n\\nuse of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of the UTI which could have lowered her\\n\\nthreshold for seizure activity.  Upon discharge, the patient was in stable condition.\\n\\n\\n\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for seizure, type II diabetes mellitus,\\n\\npanhypopituitarism secondary to pituitary surg, hypertension, right arm bone\\n\\ntumor excision associated with right radial neuropathy, and hyperlipidemia.\\n\\n\\n\\nMEDICATIONS:  See LMR.\\n\\nFAMILY HISTORY:  Negative.\\n\\nSOCIAL HISTORY:  Denies alcohol intake, smoking.\\n\\n\\n\\nREVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Denies visual or hearing disturbance, headaches,\\n\\nweakness, numbness, seizure activity, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, dyspnea,\\n\\nwheezing, cough, coryza, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain. \\n\\n\\n\\nPositive for mild nocturia with no dysuria.
