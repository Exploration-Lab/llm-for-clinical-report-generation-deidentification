# Preprocessing
We have five datasets: n2c2 2006, n2c2 2014, ICDS-R (real dataset from SGPGI), ICDS-G(l) (Llama-generated discharge summaries), and ICDS-G(g) (Gemini-generated discharge summaries). The Preprocessing folder contains preprocessing scripts for all the datasets.

We showed a piece of annotated medical text and preprocessed medical text with BIO tagging.
