# Analysis and Comparision of Datasets

The notebooks in the Analysis and Comparison of Datasets folders are used to analyze various biomedical real and synthetic datasets against each other in terms of their n-gram frequencies, Jaccard distance, and BERTScore (using BioBERT). The notebooks also produce visualizations for the n-gram frequencies. Depending on the file format (JSON, XML, etc.), they were parsed and stored as strings, and then iterated through for further lexical analysis.
