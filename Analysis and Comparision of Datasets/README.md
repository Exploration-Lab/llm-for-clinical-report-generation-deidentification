# Analysis and Comparision of Datasets

The notebooks in the Analysis and Comparision of Dataset folders are used to analyze various biomedical real and synthetic datasets against each other in terms of their n-gram frequencies, Jaccard distance, and BERTScore (using bio-bert). The notebooks also yielded visualizations for the n-gram frequencies. Depending on the type of file format (json, xml etc), they were parsed and stored in strings, and then iterated through for further lexical analysis.
